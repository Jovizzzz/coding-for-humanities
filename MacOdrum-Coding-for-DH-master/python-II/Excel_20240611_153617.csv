Digital humanities ,"Carter, Bryan. ",,,"Education -- Computers & Technology; Education -- Higher; Education -- General; ""Educational equipment & technology, computer-aided learning (CAL)""; Colleges of higher education; Humanities -- Electronic information resources; Humanities -- Computer network resources",,,"Includes bibliographical references and index.; The field of Digital Humanities is becoming more exciting as the number of low-cost or free mobile and desktop applications flood the market allowing users to accomplish tasks that only a few years ago were either not possible or required complicated coding or high-end computing power. The range of these applications provides access to digital communications, advanced visualization, data storage and retrieval at unprecedented levels. Digital Humanists are incorporating these tools as part of our teaching, research, and creative expression. This research volume approaches the topic from a perspective that will be attractive to those just beginning, through the step by step guides to set up and use of a variety of tools with accompanying objectives, and to those who are more advanced, through more challenging applications and their use for teaching and research. Furthermore this text will be of interest to administrators or those sceptical about the Digital Humanities, as the essays will highlight studies and research by experts in the field while maintaining the particular perspective on literary studies and Digital Africana Studies. This volume includes an introduction to the Digital Humanities and chapters on The Social Web, Communications, Visualization and Collaboration.; Print version record",Introduction to digital humanities / Bryan W.

"New digital worlds : postcolonial digital humanities in theory, praxis, and pedagogy ","Risam, Roopika author. ",,,Postcolonialism -- Study and teaching; Postcolonialism in literature; Digital humanities; Digital humanities -- Study and teaching,,,"Includes bibliographical references (pages 145-169) and index.; New Digital Worlds traces the formation of postcolonial studies and digital humanities as fields, identifying how they can intervene in knowledge production in the digital age. Roopika Risam examines the role of colonial violence in the development of digital archives and the possibilities of postcolonial digital archives for resisting this violence. Offering a reading of the colonialist dimensions of global organizations for digital humanities research, she explores efforts to decenter these institutions by emphasizing the local practices that subtend global formations and pedagogical approaches that support this decentering. Last, Risam attends to human futures in new digital worlds, evaluating both how algorithms and natural language processing software used in digital humanities projects produce universalist notions of the ""human"" and also how to resist this phenomenon.",Introduction: The postcolonial digital cultural record -- Stakes of postcolonial digital humanities -- Colonial violence and the postcolonial digital archive -- Remaking the global worlds of digital humanities -- Postcolonial digital pedagogy -- Rethinking the human in digital humanities -- Conclusion: A call to action.,,"Postcolonial digital humanities in theory, praxis, and pedagogy",LC :   2018024920; ISBN : 9780810138858; ISBN : 0810138859; ISBN : 9780810138865; ISBN : 0810138867; ISBN : 0810138875; ISBN : 9780810138872; OCLC : (OCoLC)1039435063,"Available in other form: New Digital Worlds : Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and Pedagogy ",,"Evanston, Illinois : Northwestern University Press",2019,"viii, 176 pages : illustrations, maps ; 23 cm",,,,,Library Catalog,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/j2o5om/alma991008092579705153

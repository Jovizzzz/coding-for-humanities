## My takeout on todayâ€™s workshop is mainly about the text analysis on literature via python, especially the tools that Chantal uses. By reading her code, I learnt many packages and functions that I am not so familiar with. And she just employed them to conduct the task of counting the keywords that appear in the passage, which is a fundamental technique that we may work with very often in our research later. Through this action, we can simply find out the high-frequency meaningful words in the paper, so as to extract the main idea. This is a novel tool that is better than the traditional methods of reading in that it can greatly improve our efficacy on literature review. Next, I think the next step should be visualizing the result of text analysis by some chart such as the word cloud. I look forward to knowing how to do that in Python.

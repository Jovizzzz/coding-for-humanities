## Priority questions
### How can the variables we deal with in humanities be transferred/adapted to computational ones?
It depends on the kind of variable we are going to deal with. For numerical ones, we can treat them as usual; in terms of the categorical ones, we may use the one-hot encoding to convert them to the binary variables so that we can easily employ them in the research.

### What are the basic computational skills?
To do descriptive statistics, to extract the insightful information from the results such as the distribution of the data. To visualize the results by some charts like the word cloud.

### How can we collect data?
Via Internet resources and library, from the digitalized literature.
